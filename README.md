# Advent of Code TypeScript Template

This repository provides a simple template for solving Advent of Code problems using TypeScript and Node.js.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Holly-Tech-AB/aoc-templates.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```


3. Solve Advent of Code problems:
- Create a folder for each day's problem in the `src/` directory.
- Implement the `solve` function in the `index.ts` file for each day.
- Run the solution for a specific day using:
```
npm start dayX
```
  Replace `X` with the day number you want to run.

4. Add your input files:
- Place input files for each day in the respective folders (`src/dayX/input.txt`).

5. **Customize the project as needed and have fun solving Advent of Code challenges!**
